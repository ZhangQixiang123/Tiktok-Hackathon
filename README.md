# Tiktok-Hackathon

## How to Run

Follow these steps to set up and run the project:

1. **Clone the Project**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ZhangQixiang123/Tiktok-Hackathon.git
   ```

2. **Install Python 3**

      Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
      
3. **Enter Virtual Environment**
      
      It's recommended to create and activate a virtual environment to manage dependencies. This isolates your project's environment from the system's Python installation.

4. **Install Django**

   ```bash
    py -3 -m pip install django~=4.0
    This will install the necessary version of Django.
   ```
5. **Start the Server**

    Navigate to the directory containing manage.py and run the following command:
    ```bash
    py -3 manage.py runserver
    This will start the Django development server.


Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to view the application.
